## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Reducer
- ThemeContext

### What I learned

I've learned how to use useReducer function to perform certian actions and dispatch them. The biggest challange and take away here was to create customer ThemeContext and pass down all the theme classes depending on client theme choice.

### Continued development

There is still a lot to learn. I will continue to build projects where I will strengthen my foundations and understanding of React. My goal is to build upcoming projects with Next.JS and Redux.
